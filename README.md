This repository contains the source code for my professional academic website: [rreysa.github.io](https://rreysa.github.io).  
Like any project, it didn’t appear out of nowhere. It builds on the generosity of others who have shared their own designs and code.

## 🌱 Inspirations

Two academic websites have been particularly influential in shaping mine:

1. [**Silvia Canelón**](https://silviacanelon.com): her site served as the initial structural template that helped me get started.  
2. [**Matthew B. Jané**](https://matthewbjane.github.io): his design inspired the layout and styling of my **CV** section.

These websites offered the foundation and spirit for this project. From there, I iteratively developed the rest with the help of **ChatGPT**, which has shown remarkable patience answering the same `.scss` question twenty different ways.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

This website is built with **[Quarto](https://quarto.org)**: an open-source publishing framework for reproducible and interactive documents.

- **Language and framework:** Quarto with Markdown, R, and HTML.  
- **Styling:** Custom **SCSS** theme with coordinated light and dark variants.  
- **Structure overview:**
  - `_quarto.yml` — global site configuration and navigation settings.  
  - `index.qmd` — homepage entry point.
  - `/about/` — personal and professional background.  
  - `/blog/` — posts and research notes on methods, modeling, and open science.  
  - `/cv/` — academic curriculum and timeline.  
  - `/research/` — complementary materials and updates related to my published papers.  
  - `/assets/` — SCSS templates, color palettes, logos, and other design elements.  

All posts and pages are rendered to static HTML using Quarto’s publishing engine and deployed automatically through **GitHub Pages**.

## 🎨 Design and Credits

All logos were designed by **Alicia Franco-Martínez**. The **light-theme color palette** is directly inspired by the one used in **Stan**, for two reasons:

1. It’s the most elegant “light mode” palette I’ve found — it simply works beautifully.  
2. It’s a small tribute to the programming language that has accompanied me through most of my PhD journey.

Typography, spacing, and iconography have been fine-tuned for clarity and visual balance.
